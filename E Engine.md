E Engine is a project I'm working on to create my own custom game engine. It's written in Rust, and I don't know if I'm going to use [OpenGl](https://www.opengl.org/) or [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) as the rendering backend yet.
I also haven't decided on a window framework yet, and my two choices seem to be [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) or [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/). Might need to look around to see if there are other options for those.
I think I want to use either [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) with [imgui-rs](https://crates.io/crates/imgui) or [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui) for UI elements.
Likely going with [FMOD](http://studio.fmod.com/) or [Wwise](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/products/wwise/) for audio as those are the two I'm most familiar with.
