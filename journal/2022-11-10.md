# Thursday, November 10, 2022 - "Rigid-Body System Success"

Today was pretty cool. I managed to get a big task for the game project I'm working on for school done with my friend and teammate Mike. We managed to make a working rigid-body collision system for the game.
I joined a club Mike's running where we volunteer to help out the community around here.

Things are going pretty good, I'm gonna make some brownies tomorrow morning :)
