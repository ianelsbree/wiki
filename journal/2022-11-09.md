## CS-251

Graphics class today went over shadows and how you need another render pass to calculate a depth map of the scene, so that you can tell what's occluding what. This pass is done from the perspective of the light source.

## CS-225

You can use a static variable in the class to keep track of the number of objects that are currently alive or are created for the current assignment.
Different STL containers will have different algorithms that work well with them. For example, vectors are really bad at pushing to the front, but deques are good at doing that. The STL tries to push you to write efficient algorithms, and tries to make it harder to write inefficient ones. Vectors, deques, and lists all have different things they're really good at doing. Try to use things for the things they're good at, and avoid the one's they're not.
