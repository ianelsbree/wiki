# Monday, November 14, 2022 - "Major Fixes"

Today I made some major improvements to the rigidbody collision system I made for the game project I'm working on. Now sprites no longer disappear when an object collides with another object. This is a big deal, as it means now the player character can walk around on platforms and still look correct. I feel great about this; it's a big win. I also ironed out some other things to make the collider code a bit cleaner, so that's a bonus. I also documented some parts that weren't exactly self-explanatory.
